# Security Camera Application
This is a security camera application built with Raspberry Pi 3b and Oracle Cloud object storage. The web console was written in Spark Java web application framework and a Bootstrap 4 based UI.

The camera portion was written in Python 2.7 and uses the OpenCV library. The Raspberry Pi python script will need to be deployed on a capable Raspberry Pi (only tested with 3b and 3b+) running Linux. I will also need at least one USB web camera to be plugged in at the time of the script running.
